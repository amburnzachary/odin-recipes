        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoon pesto</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring 
                to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. 
                Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until 
                tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain and transfer into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low 
                heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 
                3 minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until 
                warmed through.</li>
            <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese
                 and toss well to coat.</li>
        </ol>
